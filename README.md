# Marvel Comics App ü¶∏üèºüßæ

This Rails project uses the Marvel API to display character data and other related information. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS, and the app is primarily tested using RSpec.

The app allows you to search for your favorite Marvel character (like Hulk, for example) and then get a random story that they appear in. Once you search, the app shows the story‚Äôs description, lists the names and pictures of the characters featured in the story. At the bottom of every page, you can also find the required Marvel attribution text. `(Data provided by Marvel. ¬© 2024 MARVEL)`

In short, this was a great way to enhance my Ruby on Rails skills and also get to know more stories and characters in the Marvel universe!
